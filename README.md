# rock-paper-scissors

This project simulates the game Rock, Paper, and Scissors which is played in the console window of the Chrome DevTools between the human and the computer. There are five consecutive rounds in which the player and computer choose between playing rock, paper, or scissors and the winner of the round earns points which are added to their total score. The player with the most amount of points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

This project also introduces the basics of programming through JavaScript which is the programming language used to implement interactive features for websites.
